## ðŸ¤– AI Usage Notes

AI Used: 
- ChatGPT 5 for general purpose advice and assistant
- Gemini Pro: for advance debugging and reasoning that require bigger context and more thoughtful approach

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools to enhance productivity and ensure best practices during development. Below are the specific areas where AI was utilized:

### 1. Debugging
AI was used to identify and resolve issues in the codebase, including syntax errors, logic bugs, and performance optimizations. It provided insights and suggestions to improve the stability and efficiency of the application.

### 2. Deployment Initialization
AI assisted in generating and refining deployment configuration files such as:
- `docker-compose.yml` â€” for orchestrating multiple services in containers.  
- `Dockerfile` â€” for defining build instructions and runtime environments.  

These configurations were further customized and tested manually to fit the projectâ€™s infrastructure needs.

### 3. Database Schema Design and Feedback
AI provided guidance in designing the database schema, including table structures, relationships, and data constraints.  
It also offered feedback and optimization suggestions to ensure scalability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
